        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high - level programming language that is easy to understand and write, making it a popular choice among developers and programmers.\n",
        "   Python is so popular due to its readability and simplicity, extensive libraries, strong community support, versatality, etc.\n",
        "2.  What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  -  Interpreter is a program that reads python code and executes it line by line.\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (variable names, function names, etc).\n",
        "  These keywords are - False, await, else, import, pass, None, break, except, in, raise, True, class, finally, is, return, and, continue, for, lambda, try, as, def, from, nonlocal, while, assert, del, global, not, with, async, elif, if, or, yield.\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "  - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in Python.\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability in Python refers to whether an object’s state or content can be changed after it is created.\n",
        "  Mutability affects how objects are stored and manipulated in memory, impacting performance, memory usage, and concurrency in Python programs.\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        "  - Lists are designed to be flexible, general-purpose containers while Tuples are meant to be fixed collections of items — like records or keys.\n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        "  - The difference between the == and is operators in python are:\n",
        "== (equality operator): It compares the values of two objects. It returns True if the values are equal and False otherwise.\n",
        "is (identity operator): It compares the identity of two objects. It returns True if two variables point to the same object in memory and False otherwise.\n",
        "8. 18 What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        "  - Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements. Python has three logical operators: and, or, not.\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "  - Type casting, also referred to as type conversion, is the process of changing one data type to another in Python. Python provides built-in functions for type casting, such as int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), dict(), etc.\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting?\n",
        "  - Implicit type casting can be done automatically by python. It happens when no data loss is expected. It usually occurs in mixed-type expressions while Explicit Type Casting can be done manually by the programmer, we have to convert one type to another, there is a risk of data loss or truncation (e.g., float to int).\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "  - Conditionals in Python are used to execute code based on the evaluation of one or more conditions.\n",
        "  Conditionals can be nested to handle multiple conditions and control different branches of execution based on the outcome of logical expressions.\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "  - The elif (\"else if\") statement is used to check multiple conditions sequentially after an if statement.\n",
        "  Python checks condition1:\n",
        "  If True, it runs block 1 and skips all others. If False, it checks condition2, and so on.\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "  - “for” loops are used for iterating over a sequence of elements, while “while” loops are used for executing code until a specified condition becomes false.\n",
        "14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "  - response = \"\"\n",
        "      while response != \"yes\":\n",
        "       response = input(\"Please type 'yes' to continue: \")\n",
        "      print(\"Thank you for typing 'yes'!\")\n",
        "\n",
        "      A for loop would require a fixed number of iterations, which doesn't work in this scenario where the number of attempts is dynamic and depends on the user input. This is a simple, everyday use case where the while loop excels because the loop should keep running until a condition is met, not for a fixed number of times."
